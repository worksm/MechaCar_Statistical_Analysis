## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

Vehicle weight, AWD, and spoiler angle provide a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset. The slope of the linear model is not zero based on the R squared value of .71 adjusted R-squared at .68, which also informs us that this linear model will predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. In total, the MechaCar suspension coils variance meets the goal of not exceeding 100 pounds per square inch, with all lots variance coming in at 62.3, however Lot 3 falls short with a variance exceeding 100 significantly at 170. 

## T-Tests on Suspension Coils
Assuming our significance level was the common 0.05 percent, our p-value is above our significance level at .06 percent. We do not have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis, the two means are statistically similar.

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition.

To determine how MechaCar stands up to the competition, the recommendation would be to study cost, fuel efficiency, safety ratings, HP, and AWD. Using random samples. Utilizing a null hypothesis indicating the two competitors are statistically similar. T-tests would be enlisted to test the hypothesis due to it's ease of use. Similar data from MechaCar and the competitors would be used, like the testing above. The variables would change.
