## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

Vehicle weight, AWD, and spoiler angle provide a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset. The slope of the linear model is not zero based on the R squared value of .71 adjusted R-squared at .68, which also informs us that this linear model will predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. In total, the MechaCar suspension coils variance meets the goal of not exceeding 100 pounds per square inch, with all lots variance coming in at 62.3, however Lot 3 falls short with a variance exceeding 100 significantly at 170. 

## T-Tests on Suspension Coils
Assuming our significance level was the common 0.05 percent, our p-value is above our significance level at .06 percent. We do not have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis, the two means are statistically similar.

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition.

Write a short description of a statistical study that can quantify how the MechaCar performs against the competition. In your study design, think critically about what metrics would be of interest to a consumer: for a few examples, cost, city or highway fuel efficiency, horse power, maintenance cost, or safety rating.

What metric or metrics are you going to test?
What is the null hypothesis or alternative hypothesis?
What statistical test would you use to test the hypothesis? And why?
What data is needed to run the statistical test?
